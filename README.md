## What is lib.Freecraft?

The lib.Freecraft is the major project of Freecraft, it is written in C++ and it contains almost every features of Freecraft except a Frontend. Major functionalition like world generation, physics, entity, effect and numberic calculations, world state shareing through web, and many more are implememted and standerdlized by this library.

The seperation of library and frontends is better than combining into one, because the seperetion will more friendly to the MOD developers, or content creaters (e.g. movie creator, texture creator, etc.), another sreat reason is the maintainbility.

## How will it be developed?

The lib.Freecraft is released whether Apache-2.0 License, the whole project will be built by CMake, and we (all the contributors, I mean) will also make some useful tiny tools for the generation and modificetion of codes, these tools' source code will put into root/tools_src/ directory. Just like the main project, we also have rules to this codes, see the same file for main project's code.

Currently and unfortunately, the whole Freecraft is developed by myself. It seems no one is interested in this project because (I guess,) they think this project is just a hack of Minecraft and the Freecraft will have no innovation above Minecraft. They didn't see the goal of Freecraft, and how hyper-extensible, config flexible, control-verious the Freecraft could be.


If you are interested in this project, wanna contribute to it, make suggestions to it or make Pull Requests, you are right on the way. You are welcomed to make any contributions to this project in any methods.

The frontend of Freecraft can be various, and these frontends should also be ruled by some standards. If you want to learn more, click [this](https://github.com/dimensium/CodingStandard).


## How can I contribute to this project?

Just by developing. To develop more efficiently, just try out your best tools. We won't mention boring suggestions like these again.
